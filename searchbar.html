With the barbell at your feet, grab the bar with both hands around shoulder width apart. With your back straight, bring your butt down and pull the weight up. TIP: Try to feel this exercise in your hamstrings.",

Take a deep breath and, with your back straight, squat down until your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle. Then, stand back up straight, using your legs to drive the weight back up."
