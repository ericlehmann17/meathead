        <h1>About this Webpage</h1>
        <p>My name is Eric Lehmann, the creator of this website, and I am a computer science student at UMass Amherst. This page serves as a simple tool that can help anyone and everyone who is interested in lifting weights. When I first started lifting weights, one of the most difficult obstacles I had to overcome was simply learning all of the many different weightlifting techniques - the best form for each exercise, the best rep ranges/number of sets to optimize muscle growth, etc. 
            I am creating this website to serve those who struggled like me. I want this to be a place where beginners can easily learn about all sorts of different exercises at the click of a button.
