# meathead
Meathead is a website-in-progress that functions as a lightweight search engine for various gym exercises. Searching an exercise will return a short description of the exercise, what muscle group it targets, and how to perform it.

Currently, the search engine code is a simple JS script that requires the user to submit the name of an exercise, and will return a short description of that exercise. If the name of the exercise is misspelled, the engine will tell you "there are no exercises of that name." The engine simply iterates over a dictionary full of key:value pairs, searching for the key that matches the user-submitted exercise name, and returns the corresponding value (the exercise description).

The "about" page gives a short desrciption, similar to this one, about who I am, why I am doing this project, and how it works. 

### Open index.html in the project directory with a web browser to view the production build of the site.
